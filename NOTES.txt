In Java,
    Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation
    of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes.


What is StringBuilder? 
        StringBuilder in Java represents a mutable sequence of characters.
        Since the String Class in Java creates an immutable sequence of characters, 
                the StringBuilder class provides an alternative to String Class, 
                as it creates a mutable sequence of characters. 

        The function of StringBuilder is very much similar to the StringBuffer class,
        as both of them provide an alternative to String Class by making a mutable sequence of characters.


        However, 
                the StringBuilder class differs from the StringBuffer class on the basis of synchronization. 
                The StringBuilder class provides no guarantee of synchronization whereas the StringBuffer class does.


        StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder();
         str.append("PRABH");
 
        // print string
        System.out.println("String = " + str.toString());



Why use @override in Java?

        The @Override annotation indicates that the 
        child class method is over-writing its base class method. 
        It extracts a warning from the compiler if the annotated method doesn't actually override anything. 
        It can improve the readability of the source code


what is the use of e.getSource()?
        The getSource method is used in the actionPerformed method to determine which button was clicked.


How to run a program through another program?
        Just put the two files in the same directory. and simply call that class as if it was in the same program file.


What is JFrame in Java?

        JFrame is a top-level container that provides a window on the screen.
        A frame is actually a base window on which other components rely, namely
        the menu bar, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc.
        Almost every other Swing application starts with the JFrame window.


What is Applet? 
        An applet is a Java program that can be embedded into a web page. 
        It runs inside the web browser and works at client side.
        An applet is embedded in an HTML page using the APPLET or OBJECT tag and hosted on a web server.
        Applets are used to make the website more dynamic and entertaining.



        The type Applet is deprecated since version 9
        Deprecated The Applet API is deprecated, no replacement.

        An applet is a small program that is intended not to be run on its own, but rather to be embedded inside another application.
        The Applet class must be the superclass of any applet that is to be embedded in a Web page or viewed by the Java Applet Viewer. 
        The Applet class provides a standard interface between applets and their environment.
